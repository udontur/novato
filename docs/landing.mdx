## Novato Bacteria News
At 8:44pm, Janurary 2, 2023, the Novato Meteor rushed toward Earth, a small fireball that sparkled in the night sky. Just 34 cm in diameter, it broke into thousands of pieces as it entered Earth’s atmosphere. 

Tiny pebbles rained down on a small town in California, where several residents reported loud clunking on their roofs. A large fragment, about the size of a golf ball, plunged right into Mr. Feynman’s bird bath where he found it the next morning. 

He was the first person infected. They named the bacteria after the meteorite on which it arrived: The Novato Bacteria.

The world population is decreasing faster than ever due to the spread of the Novato bacteria, known to most people as the space bug. Global warming is accelerating. 

Project Novato is a team of scientists to develop an effective plan to stop the spread of the bacteria.
