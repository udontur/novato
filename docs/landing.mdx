Project Novato is a team of scientist established to eradicate the Novato Bacteria. But it's not just us, we need you, we need everyone, we need humanity to save humanity. We're here to get the technical stuff done.

## Novato Bacteria
At 8:44pm, Janurary 2, 2023, the Novato Meteor rushed toward Earth, a small fireball that sparkled in the night sky. Just 34 cm in diameter, it broke into thousands of pieces as it entered Earth’s atmosphere. Tiny pebbles rained down on a small town in California, where several residents reported loud clunking on their roofs. A large fragment, about the size of a golf ball, plunged right into Mr. Feynman’s bird bath where he found it the next morning. He was the first person infected. They named the bacteria after the meteorite on which it arrived: The Novato Bacteria.

The world population is decreasing faster than ever due to the spread of the Novato bacteria, known to most people as the space bug. Global warming is accelerating. Project Novato is a team of scientists to develop an effective plan to stop the spread of the bacteria.

## Our Research
//TODO: Put the cards here
//TODO: Add vercel analytics to spy on users (Yes you, idk who sees this btw)
//TODO: Add vercel speed test (idk what to use it for but it sounds cool)
//TODO: Hightlight important parts

### Weird statistics
Total hours wasted on debugging the website: ```1.5``` (My failed deployments: [Vercel Deploy](https://vercel.com/udonturs-projects/novato/deployments))

Total hours wasted on selecting a framework template: ```at least 2``` (i am too picky, deleted the repo multiple times)

Total hours wasted on making the website look what I wanted: ```at least 3 hours```

Total hours wasted on researching other topics while researching this assignment (ADHD): ```so much that i lost count```

Conclusion: I am bad at coding + I have ADHD.
