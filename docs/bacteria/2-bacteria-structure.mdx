# Bacteria Structure

To fight Novato, which is a bacteria, we need to first understand the fundemental structure of bacteria. Let's take a look at the following diagram about a typical bacteria structure (Adobe Stock, n.d.):

>  Figure 1, Bacteria Cell Structure Diagram

There are 9 main structures in a bacteria:

### Flagellum
The flagship feature of a bacteria: the flagellum. It is the "tail" part of a bacteria, which acts as a locomotion organelle. The flagellum provides forward momentum for the bacteria's movement by attaching to the end of the bacteria with a molecular motor.

Just like an electrical motor, the molecular motor yield rotation, rotating the flagellum to propel the bacteria forward. The motor is made of proteins and nucleic acids arranged regularly. 

::: info[NOTE]
Not all bacteria have a tail. These bacterias are called bacteriophage, which looks like spiders from futuristic sci-fi movies.

- Flagellum
	- The "tail" that propells the bacteria forward
	- A little motor is attached
- Pilus
	- Act like spider legs
	- Used to attach the bacteria to specific surfaces or cells
- Plasmid
	- Double-stranded circular DNA molecules (NOT a regular chromosome)
	- Carry genes for
		- Copying chromosome
		- Create antibiotic resistance
- Cytoplasm
	- Gel-like structure
	- The area for metabolism and replication
- DNA (Nucleoid)
	- Double-stranded DNA molecules
	- Genetic material for building the bacteria
- Cell wall
	- Made with peptidoglycan
	- Key: Gram-Positive vs Gram-Negative
- Ribosomes
	- Protein synthesis
		- A process that makes protein using generic materials
- Capsule
	- Made of polysaccharides
	- Thick external layer that envelopes the cell wall 
	- Protective barrier
		- Evading immune system
		- No toxic compounds
- Cell membrane (Plasma membrane)
	- regualte substamce movment in and out of the cell
		- Waste excretion
		- Respiration + photosynthesis
		- Nutrient acquisition
- Bacterias are prokaryotic cells -> Genetic material is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane. 
- Prokaryotic type
	- Archaea (no peptidoglycan in cell wall)
	- Bacteria
