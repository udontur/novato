# The Grams
You have seen us mentioned gram-positive and gram-negative everywhere now. But what is gram-positive and gram-negative?

And yes, Novato is a gram-positive bacteria.

## Gram Positive

 **Gram positive**: There is a thick peptidoglycan layer in front of the cell membrane. Since peptidoglycan can absorb antibiotics effectively, gram positive bacteria is less dangerous.Â **MORE PLEASEPLASEPALSEPLASEPLASEPLASEPL**
## Gram Negative
Gram negative: There is a thin peptidoglycan layer behind the cell membrane. Since the cell membrane cannot absorb any external substance, gram negative bacteria are more dangerous as it is harder to kill them. 
- Gram negative bacteria has a outer membrane. This barrier is the main shield for resisting antibiotic and medication absorbsion. 
	- Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are extended chains of sugar molecules are on the surface of the bacteria. LPS is hydrophoic, which means the layer is resistant to water.
	- It is harder for antibiotics to penetrate the bacteria because of the hydrophobic area produced by the LPS (the water is not directly next to the bacteria, which is how antibiotics float to the bacterias).
	- Lysozyme enzymes cannot get near the bacteria to break the cell wall due to the hydrophobic area produced by the LPS (the water is not directly next to the bacteria, which makes the enzyme harder to reach the surface of the bacteria to break the cell wall)
	- Gram negative bacteria has a higher concentration of transportation proteins compared to gram positive bacteria. High concentration of transportation protiens can force harmful drugs out of the bactera before it reaches core elements like the nucleaus. 
	- There are 2 main kinds of transportation protien
		1. Outer membrane protein (OMP)
		2. Inner membrane protein (IMP)
## Gram Staining
The classification of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can be done using gram staining, which is a common lab prosedure developed in the 1880s. 

This bacteriological laboratory technique uses a crystal violet stain and checks the remaining color. 

If the remaining color is violet, then it is a gram-positive bacteria as the peptidoglycan absorbed the stain. 

If the remaining color is pink, then it is a gram-negative bacteria as the thin peptidoglycan and the outer memebrane cannot absorb and retain the stain. 

Let's take a deep dive on the bacteriological testing prosedure:
1. Prepare an uncontaminated slip of bacteria sample.
2. Apply a crystal violet primary stain onto to the slip.
3. Heat fix the bacteria slip using fire.
	- This process will kill some bacteria.
	- But this prevents the bacteria from washing away in the following steps.
4. Add iodine on the slip.
5. Rinse the slip with some ethonal drops to decolorize the bacteria.
6. Finally, counterstaine the slip with Safranin ($\text{C}_{20}\text{H}_{19}\text{ClN}_{4}$) and check the result.

If the color of the slip is violet, then the bacteria slip is gram-positive. If the color of the slip is pink, then the bacteria slip is gram-negative.

### Why is bacteria so hard to kill
- Drug resistant
	- Natural genes: genes conferring resistance are already in the bactera's chromosomes
		- Unnatural factors:
			- Aquire the gene through mutation
			- Pick up antibiotic resistant genes from other microbes
