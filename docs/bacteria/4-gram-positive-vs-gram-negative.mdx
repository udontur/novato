# Gram-Positive VS Gram-Negative
- **Gram positive**: There is a thick peptidoglycan layer in front of the cell membrane. Since peptidoglycan can absorb antibiotics effectively, gram positive bacteria is less dangerous.Â **MORE PLEASEPLASEPALSEPLASEPLASEPLASEPL**
- Gram negative: There is a thin peptidoglycan layer behind the cell membrane. Since the cell membrane cannot absorb any external substance, gram negative bacteria are more dangerous as it is harder to kill them.
	- Gram negative bacteria has a outer membrane. This barrier is the main shield for resisting antibiotic and medication absorbsion.
	- Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are extended chains of sugar molecules are on the surface of the bacteria. LPS is hydrophoic, which means the layer is resistant to water. 
	- It is harder for antibiotics to penetrate the bacteria because of the hydrophobic area produced by the LPS (the water is not directly next to the bacteria, which is how antibiotics float to the bacterias).
	- Lysozyme enzymes cannot get near the bacteria to break the cell wall due to the hydrophobic area produced by the LPS (the water is not directly next to the bacteria, which makes the enzyme harder to reach the surface of the bacteria to break the cell wall)
	- Gram negative bacteria has a higher concentration of transportation proteins compared to gram positive bacteria. High concentration of transportation protiens can force harmful drugs out of the bactera before it reaches core elements like the nucleaus. 
	- There are 2 main kinds of transportation protien
		1. Outer membrane protein (OMP)
		2. Inner membrane protein (IMP)
- Why is bacteria so hard to kill
	- Drug resistant
		- Natural genes: genes conferring resistance are already in the bactera's chromosomes
		- Unnatural factors:
			- Aquire the gene through mutation
			- Pick up antibiotic resistant genes from other microbes
