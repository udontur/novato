# Optimal Conditions for Bacterial Growth
There are a lot of different types of bacteria, and they all require different conditions to survive. Common survival conditions include temperature and pH. 

When the environment exceeds these survivial conditions, the bacteria eradicates because of protein denature and organelle damage. More on that in the "Eradication" section.

## Temperature
Just like animals, temperature is a major factor when determining the types of bacteria. There are two main categories of bacteria regarding temperature, which is psychrophiles, mesophilies, and thermophilies. There are two more categories called hyperthermophilies and extreme-hyperthermophilies, surviving up to $120^\circ\text{C}$! 

"-philie", you have seen this suffix for a lot of times now. It simply means "-loving". "thermo-philies" means this category of bacteria loves thermal or heat. These bacteria are evolved to grow optimally in specific conditions. Bacteria that grow in more extreme conditions are called extremophiles.

### Psychrophile
Psychrophiles are bacteria that loves colder temperature. They usually live in 
- Ice: averaging under $0^\circ\text{C}$
- Ocean water: averaging around $5^\circ\text{C}$
- Soil in temperate zones: averaging around $12^\circ\text{C}$. 
(Britannica, 2024)

Psychrophiles can survive as low as $-10^\circ\text{C}$ and up to $15^\circ\text{C}$. However, the optimal growth temperature is usually $10^\circ\text{C}$, which is still very cold compared to the more common pathogens found in animals (Britannica, 2024).

Most psychrophilic bacteria are gram-negative bacteria and commonly serves as an ocean biodegrader and biofertilizers to support the earth's ecosystem. 

### Mesophile
Mesophiles are bacteria that loves moderate temperate. They usually live in
- Soil: averaging $15^\circ\text{C}$ to $25^\circ\text{C}$
- Animal body: averaging from $36^\circ\text{C}$ to $39^\circ\text{C}$
- Human body: around $37^\circ\text{C}$
(MSD Manual, n.d.)

They can survive between $20^\circ\text{{C}}$ and $45^\circ\text{C}$, and grow optimally from $33^\circ\text{C}$ to $37^\circ\text{C}$ (Britannica, 2024). 

Mesophile are the most common types of bacteria. They serve a lot of functionality in the ecosystem, this includes decomposition, fermentation, digestive systems, and ecological balance. 
#### Decomposition
- Decomposition
#### Fermentation
Fermentation is a metabolic process that turns sugar into acid, gases, and alcohol without oxygen. Fermentation is used in food production such as cheese, alcohol, and yogurt because it enhances flavours significantly just by leaving it in a controlled environment.

Cheese are so flavourful thanks to a bacteria called lactococcus lactis, which ferments lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This gives the cheese a nutty flavour that we all love (well at least I love it). 

Alcohol, the best drink for most adults, are very flavourful (I haven't drink it before) because they are all made by fermentation. Alcohol like wine, vodka, and beer are fermented using glucose, maltose, and fructose, from different vegetation like grapes, potatos, and wheat.

#### Ecological balance

#### Why is this section so long?
Because the brand new Novato bacteria is a mesophile.

### Thermophile

- Animal pathogens (including human)
	- Thermophilies
		- Optimum: $60^\circ\text{C}$
		- Rotting compost piles, hot springs, oceanic geothermal vents
		- Extreme case
			- Thermus aquaticus: $70^\circ\text{C}$
- Optimal pH
- Optimal pH: $6.8-7.2$ 
	- Acidophilies
		- Loves acidic conditions
		- $\text{pH 1} - \text{pH 5}$
	- Alkaliphilies
		- Loves alkali conditions
		- $\text{pH 9}$
