# Optimal Conditions
There are a lot of different types of bacteria, and they all require different conditions to survive. Common survival conditions include temperature and pH. 

When the environment exceeds these survivial conditions, the bacteria eradicates because of protein denature and organelle damage. More on that in the "Eradication" section.

## Temperature
Just like animals, temperature is a major factor when determining the types of bacteria. There are two main categories of bacteria regarding temperature, which is psychrophiles, mesophilies, and thermophilies. There are two more categories called hyperthermophilies and extreme-hyperthermophilies, surviving up to $120^\circ\text{C}$! 

"-philie", you have seen this suffix for a lot of times now. It simply means "-loving". "thermo-philies" means this category of bacteria loves thermal or heat. These bacteria are evolved to grow optimally in specific conditions. Bacteria that grow in more extreme conditions are called extremophiles.

### Psychrophile
Psychrophiles are bacteria that loves colder temperature. They usually live in 
- Ice: averaging under $0^\circ\text{C}$
- Ocean water: averaging around $5^\circ\text{C}$
- Soil in temperate zones: averaging around $12^\circ\text{C}$. 
(Britannica, 2024)

Psychrophiles can survive as low as $-10^\circ\text{C}$ and up to $15^\circ\text{C}$. However, the optimal growth temperature is usually $10^\circ\text{C}$, which is still very cold compared to the more common pathogens found in animals (Britannica, 2024).

Most psychrophilic bacteria are gram-negative bacteria and commonly serves as an ocean biodegrader and biofertilizers to support the earth's ecosystem. 

### Mesophile
Mesophiles are bacteria that loves moderate temperate. They usually live in
- Soil: averaging $15^\circ\text{C}$ to $25^\circ\text{C}$
- Animal body: averaging from $36^\circ\text{C}$ to $39^\circ\text{C}$
- Human body: around $37^\circ\text{C}$
(MSD Manual, n.d.)

They can survive between $20^\circ\text{{C}}$ and $45^\circ\text{C}$, and grow optimally from $33^\circ\text{C}$ to $37^\circ\text{C}$ (Britannica, 2024). 

Mesophile are the most common types of bacteria. They serve a lot of functionality in the ecosystem, this includes decomposition, fermentation, digestive systems, and ecological balance we mentioned in the first chapter. 

### Thermophile
Thermophiles are bacteria that loves heat, hence "thermo. They usually live very interesting areas in
- Hot springs (They look amazing!)
- Deep-sea hydrothermal vents 
- Volcanic areas
- Rotting compost piles

They can survive between $60^\circ\text{{C}}$ and $80^\circ\text{C}$, and usually grow optimally at around $70^\circ\text{C}$. However, these temperature really depends on the bacteria. For example, bacteria living in nutrient-rich high pressure deep sea vents can survive optimally at $110^\circ\text{C}$ (Britannica, 2024)! 

## pH
Most bacteria including mesophiles survive between $\text{pH }6-\text{pH }8$ (Britannica, 2024).

Bacteria that loves acidic conditions are called acidophiles, which survives between $\text{pH 1} - \text{pH 5}$ (Britannica, 2024).

Bacteria that loves alkaline conditions are called alkaliphiles, which survives above $\text{pH 9}$ (Britannica, 2024).

## Oxygen
Unlike animals, not all bacteria require oxygen to survive. 

Bacteria that require oxygen to grow are called aerobes. 

Bacteria that can be killed by oxygen are called anaerobes.

## Moisture and Water
This is common sense. More moisture and water, more growth as water is required for metabolic reactions. 
## Nutrient
This is also common sense. More nutrient, more growth as chemicals are required for metabolic reactions. 
## Exceeding the Conditions?
What happens when the environment exceeds the bacteria's survival condition? Well, obviously they die, but how? We will get into that in the coming chapter.
