# Bacteria Structure

#### Bacteria Structure
- ![[Pasted image 20250107132530.png]]
- Flagellum
	- The "tail" that propells the bacteria forward
	- A little motor is attached
- Pilus
	- Act like spider legs
	- Used to attach the bacteria to specific surfaces or cells
- Plasmid
	- Double-stranded circular DNA molecules (NOT a regular chromosome)
	- Carry genes for
		- Copying chromosome
		- Create antibiotic resistance
- Cytoplasm
	- Gel-like structure
	- The area for metabolism and replication
- DNA (Nucleoid)
	- Double-stranded DNA molecules
	- Genetic material for building the bacteria
- Cell wall
	- Made with peptidoglycan
	- Key: Gram-Positive vs Gram-Negative
- Ribosomes
	- Protein synthesis
		- A process that makes protein using generic materials
- Capsule
	- Made of polysaccharides
	- Thick external layer that envelopes the cell wall 
	- Protective barrier
		- Evading immune system
		- No toxic compounds
- Cell membrane (Plasma membrane)
	- regualte substamce movment in and out of the cell
		- Waste excretion
		- Respiration + photosynthesis
		- Nutrient acquisition
- Bacterias are prokaryotic cells -> Genetic material is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane. 
- Prokaryotic type
	- Archaea (no peptidoglycan in cell wall)
