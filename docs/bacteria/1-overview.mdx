## Bacteria
### Definition
Bacterium (Plural: Bacteria) is a single-cell prokaryotic organism. They always live in clusters and survive in very specific conditions. Let's take a look at the key features of Bacteria.

:::warning[Archaea have the same definition!!!]
Yes you are right! The main difference between archaea and bacteria is the presence of a peptidoglycan cell wall. Archaea DO NOT have a peptidoglycan cell wall.

### Key Features
- Each bacterium consists of one single cell only
- Bacteria are prokaryotic cells, which means there are no nuclear membrane. 
- Bacteria cell walls are made of peptidoglycan
- Bacteria reproduce asexually by binary fission (more on that in another chapter)
- Bacteria do not have membrane bounded organelles, like mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulums.

### Types
- Cocci: Sphere shaped bacteria
- Bacilli: Rod shaped bacteria
- Spirilla: Spiral shaped bacteria
- Vibrio: Kidney shaped bacteria

### Functions
Bacteria can be harmful and useful. Harmful bacteria are called pathogens. Let's take a look at some of the mesophile bacteria's function.

#### Fermentation
Fermentation is a metabolic process that turns sugar into acid, gases, and alcohol without oxygen. Fermentation is used in food production such as cheese, alcohol, and yogurt because it enhances flavours significantly just by leaving it in a controlled environment.

Cheese are so flavourful thanks to a bacteria called lactococcus lactis, which ferments lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This gives the cheese a nutty flavour that we all love (well at least I love it). 

Alcohol, the best drink for most adults, are very flavourful (I haven't drink it before) because they are all made by fermentation. Alcohol like wine, vodka, and beer are fermented using glucose, maltose, and fructose, from different vegetation like grapes, potatos, and wheat.

## Novato Bacteria
The Novato bacteria is a mesophilic pathogenic bacteria, which means it cause harm to humanity.
