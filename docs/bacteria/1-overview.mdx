## Definition
Bacterium (Plural: Bacteria) is a single-cell prokaryotic organism. They always live in clusters and survive in very specific conditions. Let's take a look at the key features of Bacteria.

:::warning[Archaea have the same definition!!!]
Yes you are right! The main difference between archaea and bacteria is the presence of a peptidoglycan cell wall. Archaea DO NOT have a peptidoglycan cell wall.

## Key Features
These are the key features that a bacterium have:
- Each bacterium consists of one single cell only
- Bacteria are prokaryotic cells, which means there are no nuclear membrane. 
- Bacteria cell walls are made of peptidoglycan
- Bacteria reproduce asexually by binary fission (more on that in another chapter)
- Bacteria do not have membrane bounded organelles, like mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulums.

## Types
There are a lot of different types of bacteria, they can be classified in shapes:
- Cocci: Sphere shaped bacteria
- Bacilli: Rod shaped bacteria
- Spirilla: Spiral shaped bacteria
- Vibrio: Kidney shaped bacteria
- Others: A lot of other different shapes

## Functions
Bacteria can be harmful and useful. Harmful bacteria are called pathogens. Let's take a look at some of the useful mesophile bacteria's function. 
### Decomposition
Decomposition is a process where dead organisms is broken down into smaller organic matter. Bacteria and fungi acts as a decomposer in this case.

Bacteria brake down these organisms using enzymes. These enzymes attaches to organic matter, and brake them down into smaller and different organic matter. These broken down organic matter can be reused by plants and trees! For example, proteins are broken down into amino acids, and carbohydrates are broken down into sugar (Byjus). 

### Fermentation
Fermentation is a metabolic process that turns sugar into acid, gases, and alcohol without oxygen. Fermentation is used in food production such as cheese, alcohol, and yogurt because it enhances flavours significantly just by leaving it in a controlled environment.

Cheese are so flavourful thanks to a bacteria called lactococcus lactis, which ferments lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This gives the cheese a nutty flavour that we all love (well at least I love it). 

Alcohol, the best drink for most adults, are very flavourful (I haven't drink it before) because they are all made by fermentation. Alcohol like wine, vodka, and beer are fermented using glucose, maltose, and fructose, from different vegetation like grapes, potatos, and wheat.

### Digestive System
There are about 100 trillion bacteria in our digestive system. They are know as gut microbiome, both good and bad (Harvard, 2023). 

The entire gut microbiome empire have a close relationship with us. They help us brake down food, absorb nutrients, and maintain our gut health, while we (host) provide shelter for them.

Interestingly, your microbiome is one of the stakeholders to decide what meal you will get for your lunch. Different bacteria will send different signal to your brain, requesting a specific food intake.

For example, a veggie loving bacteria will request the brain to eat veggies. If you don't eat veggie, these bacteria will die. When you eat excess fast food, fast food loving bacteria will thrive, and crave for more fast food. $\text{Fast Food}=\text{Unhealthy}$, every knows this equation.

If you keep your guts healthy, you will be healthy. 

### Ecological balance
We need bacteria to help us brake down food and survive. The bacteria need us in order to survive. Same goes for other animals and plants. 

Ecological balance!

## Novato Bacteria
The Novato bacteria is a mesophilic pathogenic bacteria, which means it cause harm to humanity. 

Project Novato is established to eradicate the Novato Bacteria. But it's not just us, we need you, we need everyone, we need humanity to save humanity.

Let's take a deep dive in topics regarding the Novato Bacteria.
