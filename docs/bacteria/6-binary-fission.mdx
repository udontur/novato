# Binary Fission
## Introduction
Binary Fission is the process where a bacterial cell reproduce asexually by elongating the cell body, and separating the two new "identical" cells using a cell wall. More intro info

Similar to mitosis, the sub-processes that aids binary fission can happen in parallel. 

Let's take a deep dive on how binary fission works in a bacterium.

This topic is very interesting.

## DNA Replication
Two identical chromosome is replicated because we are going to produce another identical bacterial cell. After the cell grows for a while, it needs to activate the DNA replication prosedure using DnaA, which is a common replicon protein for initiating DNA replication. The chromosome is a double-stranded circular DNA connected in the origin of replication to form a circle. 

A group of protein called replisome travels to the origin of replication, and replicates DNA bidirectionally. The DNA will extend to the left and the right side of the origin in the circle. Replisome protein includes helicase, which unpacks genetic information, primase, which synthesizes short RNA-seq, and DNA polymerase, which create DNA molecules using nucleotides (the foundation substance for DNA and RNA).  

Under the best growing conditions (provided in a lab), it takes around 40 minute on average for a bacteria to divide. However, some bacteria like E. Coli only need 20 minute as there are two (or more) origin of replication for DNA cloning. This makes the DNA replication process two times faster. 

There are more complex substance involved, but these are the basic substances that allow DNA replication to happen. 

## Pre-Seperation
After the DNA is replicated into two bundles of chromosomes, the cell need to be splitted exactly in half to retain the "identical" mindset. Hence, a Z-ring and other protein is formed to aid this process.

Before we move on, "Fts-" stands for Filaments Temperature-sensitive protein. They are a group of divisome protein that is vital for the division part of binary fission.  



Fts: filaments temperature sensitive protien 
FtsZ is a protein that is related to tublin in our cells as part of our cytoskeleton 
This is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein
Fstz will start to form a ring strucutre in the center of the cell
Inside the cytopolasmic
Z-ring: a loop of fstz protein
FstZ and ZipA used to anchor the z-ring to the cell membrane
That ring is in the middle of the cell to split them evenly
Pull down the cell membrane
Min Proteins move back and forth in the cell (more info)
Help find the center or the mid point
Sceptum forms devide split exactrly in half
FtsK will bind to replisome (more info please)
Translocase protein, allows the 2 chromsome rings to be seperated aided
These fts and zip is divisome
Cell membrane and cell wall splits and end with two identical cells
Some plasmid is not spreaded evenly
Peptidoglycan synthesis (growth)
Adding to existing peptidoglycan 
Layers cahnianed algernatively
Chanined in the NAM molecules if have multi layer
The peptidoglycan layer is the cell wall
Phsopholipid bilayer is the cell membrane
Periplasm???
First stage of peptidoghlycan synthesis: syntheiss of NAM and NAg
Create new NAm and NAG protein comming from glucose through a series of biochemical pathway, then become new sugar molecules
Second step is to transfer and elongation
Get the NAm and Nag in t he cytoplasm, through the cell membrane, to the cell wall peptidoglylcan
Third step is the formation of new peptide crosslinks
Antibiotics that disrubs synthesis of NAM and NAG called phosphomycin
Other process will continue, so will have a hole
Phosophmoycin will cause the bacteria to lyse because there is a hole that cannot be filled
A molecule called bactoprenol will bind to NAM, that is binded to a peptide chain attached to it before hand.
An NAG will bind with the binded NAM
The bacterprenol is a carrier and organizer for that structure assembled
While the ftsz ring is forming: at the site of the fitsz, autolysin will be released to cut the glycosidic links between NAm and NAG in the peptidoglycan layer
Thhe whole wall do not break because there are other layers holding them
The bacterprenol brings the structure up to the cell wall, passing the cell membrane
Peptidoglycan synthase aids the binding process between the new bacterprenol structure
The glycosylase enzyme will make the bond between new and old strcuture
Anito biotic: vancomycin will inhibit the ability of peptidoglycan snthase
The bacterprenol comes back to the cytoplasm
Disable gorwing capability: bacteriostatic
Antibiotic like bacitracin binds to the bacteprenol and now allow it to go back to cytoplasm 
When the autothing cuts the bond and wait, there are now new supply, so it weaken and die
The peptide need to bind between the new and old thing (peptide crosslinking) called transpeptidase
Antibiotic: beta-lactams classed penicillin interfere the cross bridges to form. 
CocciL new cell wall will be built right along the septum
Bacilli: mreB protein initiate the process of cell wall elongation along the lenght of the bacteria of the cell prior to the fstz ring thing
Keep the steps clear
