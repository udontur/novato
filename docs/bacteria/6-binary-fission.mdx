# Binary Fission
## Introduction
Binary Fission is the process where a bacterial cell reproduce asexually by elongating the cell body, and separating the two new "identical" cells using a cell wall. More intro info

Similar to mitosis, the sub-processes that aids binary fission can happen in parallel. 

Let's take a deep dive on how binary fission works in a bacterium.

This topic is very interesting.

## DNA Replication
Two identical chromosome is replicated because we are going to produce another identical bacterial cell. After the cell grows for a while, it needs to activate the DNA replication prosedure using DnaA, which is a common replicon protein for initiating DNA replication. The chromosome is a double-stranded circular DNA connected in the origin of replication to form a circle. 

A group of protein called replisome travels to the origin of replication, and replicates DNA bidirectionally. The DNA will extend to the left and the right side of the origin in the circle. Replisome protein includes helicase, which unpacks genetic information, primase, which synthesizes short RNA-seq, and DNA polymerase, which create DNA molecules using nucleotides (the foundation substance for DNA and RNA).  

Under the best growing conditions (provided in a lab), it takes around 40 minute on average for a bacteria to divide. However, some bacteria like E. Coli only need 20 minute as there are two (or more) origin of replication for DNA cloning. This makes the DNA replication process two times faster. 

There are more complex substance involved, but these are the basic substances that allow DNA replication to happen. 

## Pre-Cytokinesis
After the DNA is replicated into two bundles of chromosomes, the cell need to be splitted exactly in half to retain the "identical" mindset. Hence, a Z-ring and other protein is formed to aid this process.

Before we start, "Fts-" stands for Filaments Temperature-sensitive protein. They are a group of divisome protein that is vital for the division part of binary fission.  

FtsZ protein or the Filaments Temperature-Sensitive Z protein is one of the most significant protein in the binary fission process as it forms the Z-ring. FtsZ protein is related to the tublin protein group, which are cytoskeleton proteins. 

A Z-ring will be slowly constructed using a chain of FtsZ protein in the cytoplasm (configured in a loop) before the actual cytokinesis. However, a floating Z-ring would be useless. This is where the FtsA and ZipA protein comes in and anchor the ring to the cell membrane. Both of the protein form actin-like filaments, which are structured like steel cables. Since we want two identical cells, the anochors must be placed in the middle of the cell. To find the center of the bacteria, the Min group protein is moved back and forth to search for the cell's mid point. 

After the FtsA and ZipA protein anchor is placed on the correct spot, the Z ring contracts and pull down the cell membrane to form a division septum. However, the cell wall is not completely pulled down to retain the bacteria's shape. We will talk about how the cell wall is cut and reconstructed later. 

Before cytokinesis happen, we must ensure the DNA bundle is splitted correctly via the Ftsk protein. The FtsK protein will bind to the replisomes and coordinate chromosomes to  segregate. The actual segregation will be done using translocase proteins (a group of protein that assits the movement of other substance). 

## Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis is the process where the "identical" daughter cells get segregated completely. Completely detached from each other. 

:::note
They may not be "identical" because plasmids may not spread evenly between the two cells. 
:::

First, the cell membrane and the cell wall starts to contract using the Z-ring. The two DNA bundles will split apart using the FtsK protein and translocase proteins. Then, the cytoplasm divides and forms a septum. The Z-ring continues to pull down the cell membrane and the cell wall until the whole cell separates at the septum. 

Done! A fresh bacteria is reproduced! But how does the bacteria grow and segregate?

## Cell Wall Formation
In both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, there is a peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall. In this explaination, we will use gram-positive bacteria because the Novato bacteria is gram-positive. 

The cell wall is formed by peptidoglycan synthesis. 

### What are they made of?
The peptidoglycan layer forms by peptidoglycan synthesis. Each peptidoglycan molecule is a polysaccharide assembled using two glucose substance N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) cross-linked togeather with a $\beta$ -(1,4) glycosidic bond (a carbonhydrate bond). A peptidoglycan layer is made by chaining peptidoglycan molecule togeather in a uniform pattern. 

:::info
$\beta$ -(1,4) glycosidic bond is read as "beta one four glycosidic bond". 

Meaning:
- $\beta$ is a type of orientation of the bond.
- (1,4) means carbon #1 is connected to carbon #4.
- Glycosidic is a carbonhydrate bond.
:::

The cell membrane (both inner and outer membrane) is a phospholipid bilayer, which is two layers of phospholipids arranged in a sheet, with the hydrophilic head facing outwards. 

However, the peptidoglycan will not stick to the cell membranes, so periplasm is used as a "glue" and "spacer" between the peptidoglycan layer and the cell membrane (works just like a cytoplasm). 

### Cell Wall Formation Process
The first stage of peptidoglycan synthesis is the synthesis of NAM and NAG using glucose. NAM and NAG is synthesised in the cytoplasm through a series of biochemical pathways. (New sugar molecules)

New NAM and NAG molecules are now hanging around in the cytoplasm. Let's convert the sugar molecules into a basic building block of the peptidoglycan layer. To assmble this block, we need to bind NAG with NAM, and bind NAM with a polypeptide chain. Now this peptidoglycan basic structure is read for construction!

Side note: The polypeptide chain is composed of three to five amino acids chained togeather with the $\beta$ -(1,4) glycosidic bond (seems like the entire peptidoglycan layer is chained using this bond). The amino acids include L-Ala, D-Glu, mDAP, D-Ala, and L-Lys. 

To transport the building block to the peptidoglycan layer, we need to bring it up to the cell wall through the cell membrane. This is where bactoprenol comes in. Bactoprenol act as the carrier chemical for the NAM NAG structure. 

A polypeptide chain is attached to NAM. NAG is binded to NAM

---
Second step is to transfer and elongation
Get the NAm and Nag in the cytoplasm, through the cell membrane, to the cell wall peptidoglylcan
Third step is the formation of new peptide crosslinks
Antibiotics that disrubs synthesis of NAM and NAG called phosphomycin
Other process will continue, so will have a hole
Phosophmoycin will cause the bacteria to lyse because there is a hole that cannot be filled

A molecule called bactoprenol will bind to NAM, that is binded to a peptide chain attached to it before hand.

An NAG will bind with the binded NAM

The bacterprenol is a carrier and organizer for that structure assembled
While the ftsz ring is forming: at the site of the fitsz, autolysin will be released to cut the glycosidic links between NAm and NAG in the peptidoglycan layer
Thhe whole wall do not break because there are other layers holding them
The bacterprenol brings the structure up to the cell wall, passing the cell membrane
Peptidoglycan synthase aids the binding process between the new bacterprenol structure
The glycosylase enzyme will make the bond between new and old strcuture
Anito biotic: vancomycin will inhibit the ability of peptidoglycan snthase
The bacterprenol comes back to the cytoplasm
Disable gorwing capability: bacteriostatic
Antibiotic like bacitracin binds to the bacteprenol and now allow it to go back to cytoplasm 
When the autothing cuts the bond and wait, there are now new supply, so it weaken and die
The peptide need to bind between the new and old thing (peptide crosslinking) called transpeptidase
Antibiotic: beta-lactams classed penicillin interfere the cross bridges to form. 
CocciL new cell wall will be built right along the septum
Bacilli: mreB protein initiate the process of cell wall elongation along the lenght of the bacteria of the cell prior to the fstz ring thing
Keep the steps clear
