# How to treat bacterial infection
- Antibiotic binding
- Antibiotic common usage
	1. Inhibitation of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis
	2. Disruption of cell membrane integrity
	3. Inhibition of nucleic acids
	4. Inhibition of protein synthesis
	5. Distrubance of different metabolic processes

### Relate to binary fission

Also how to treat in human

Antibiotics that disrubs synthesis of NAM and NAG called phosphomycin
Other process will continue, so will have a hole
Phosophmoycin will cause the bacteria to lyse because there is a hole that cannot be filled

Anito biotic: vancomycin will inhibit the ability of peptidoglycan snthase

The bacterprenol comes back to the cytoplasm
Disable gorwing capability: bacteriostatic
Antibiotic like bacitracin binds to the bacteprenol and now allow it to go back to cytoplasm 
When the autothing cuts the bond and wait, there are now new supply, so it weaken and die
The peptide need to bind between the new and old thing (peptide crosslinking) called transpeptidase

Antibiotic: beta-lactams classed penicillin interfere the cross bridges to form.
