# Bacteria Infection
One is infected by bacteria when the bacteria invade some parts of the body, altering the body's function to cause sickness. 

::: info 
The first confirmed case of Novato bacteria infection was transmitted by airborne particles and indirect contact (house). 
:::
## Bacteria Spread
Bacteria are spread by physical contact, indirect contact, airborne transmission, and liquid transmission. 

Bacteria are transmitted mainly through the nose, mouth, and eyes. 
### Physical Contact
Physical contact refers to direct contact, such as skin-to-skin contact. It is not as common as indirect contact, but they have similar transmission efficiency.

Sanitizing your hands (with instant disinfection solutions or properly washing hands with soap) before touching food, water, eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent bacterial infection through physical contact. 
### Indirect Contact
Indirect contact refers to non-direct contact through a third medium. It involves anything that an individual touches, such as a door handle or even using the same laptop keyboard! 

For example, Hymin is infected with the Novato bacteria. He opened the door to room 331B by touching the door handle. Now, the handle is contaminated with the Novato bacteria because Hymin transferred the bacteria from his hand to the door handle (The bacteria on his hands come from his nose). Hadrian then opens the door using the same handle (on the same side), which transfers the bacteria onto Hadrian's hand. Hadrian then rubs his itchy eyes with the contaminated hand, which transports the bacteria into Hadrian's body. Hadrian is now infected with the Novato bacteria!  

Sanitizing your hands (using instant disinfection solutions or washing hands properly with soap) before touching food, water, eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent bacteria infection. 
### Airborne and Droplet Transmission
Airborne transmission refers to bacteria suspended in the air (or in water for droplet transmission), commonly produced by coughing or sneezing without covering one's mouth. 

To prevent airborne transmission, you must wear an up-to-standard mask PROPERLY to protect your vulnerable nose and mouth from infection. You can also wear glasses, which block bacteria from entering your eyes. However, bacteria are less likely to enter your eyes as they will sink slowly to the ground. 

Cover your cup of water with a lid to prevent droplet transmission to prevent bacteria from sinking into the water. 
### Vector Transmission
Vector transmission is done by insects like flies and mosquitoes. They can infect you by contaminating your food or infect the "injection hole" from the mosquitos. 
### Vehicular Transmission
Car? No! It is not the vehicle. Vehicular transmission is done by eating or drinking contaminated food. Vehicular transmission usually gives you diseases related to the guts and digestive system. 

## Symptoms
The exact symptoms of the Novato bacteria are still under research, but common earlier signs of bacteria infection are fever
## Prevention
The following are short recaps of the prevention methods we just mentioned:
- Wear a mask
- Sanitize your hand before touching your head
- Sanitize your hand before eating
- Cover your food and drink in an open area
