# Global Warming and Bacteria Growth
In the "Bacteria/Condition" section, we mentioned that most pathogens are mesophiles, which strive between $20^\circ\text{{C}}$ and $45^\circ\text{C}$, and grow optimally from $33^\circ\text{C}$ to $37^\circ\text{C}$.

Coincidently,  $33^\circ\text{C}$ to $37^\circ\text{C}$ is a prevalent summer temperature in non-temperate and arctic zones. If global warming worsens, this range will include temperate zones too. 

## More Bacteria
If global warming continues to worsen, more cities will fall in the $33^\circ\text{C}$ to $37^\circ\text{C}$ temperature range during the summer. These cities are packed with people, which means spreading bacteria is easy. 

Given these two conditions, bacteria can strive and spread better than ever, significantly contributing to human and animal sickness. This includes the new Novato bacteria.
