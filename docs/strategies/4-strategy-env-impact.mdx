# Our Strategies' Environmental Impact
Most of our products are disposable since we need to prevent the bacteria from spreading. These disposable products can fill the landfill and contaminate the surroundings with bacteria. 
## Vaccination Tubes
Vaccination tubes are made of glass, and the injection needle is made of metal. They are all single-use materials and are dumped away after one use, which can spread the bacteria if infected vaccination tubes are not disposed of correctly. 

## Disposable Surgical Mask
Since the force of the use of surgical masks, there will be a massive demand for disposable surgical masks. Surgical masks can be contaminated with bacteria but are disposed of in landfills. This can fill up the landfill and cause the bacteria to spread in the trash can, on the road to the landfill, and in the landfill areas. 

## Disposable Protective Gear
Protective gear used by medical professionals has a high chance of getting contaminated as they only use it to interact with infected individuals. However, hospitals dispose of them properly, which is not a main concern. 

## Hiking
Some unethical people will throw their masks on the hiking trail, which may infect both humans and animals walking by.

## Minimize Environmental Impact
We cannot control people disposing of the masks on the ground. The best we can do is to spread awareness of this issue to the public through TV, social media, and news outlets.
