# Our Strategies
The following are our public and non-public health strategies for battling Novato bacteria. Health strategies are a crucial part of protecting humanity without the use of eradication. 
## Public Health Strategies
These bacteria public health strategies also work for viruses. They all prevent bacterial infection instead of killing the bacteria after the infection.  
### Force Surgical Mask Use in Public Areas
For all citizens, a surgical mask must be appropriately used for ALL public areas like malls, markets, the street, MTR, etc. For this reason, ALL restaurants must be changed to take-away only. 

The surgical mask can prevent the bacteria from mass spreading as masks can block bacteria intake and output. (but not entirely). 

### Force Vaccination
After a vaccine is developed (by Dr. Jim Xiao), all citizens must take the vaccination unless there are proven medical concerns. 

Vaccines prevent bacterial infection by releasing inactive bacteria into the immune system. The immune system then indexes the bacteria and creates anti-bacterial cells for future reproduction.  
### Quarantine
Quarantine involves isolating infected individuals from the general uninfected crowd. Quarantining is very effective as it completely blocks the bacteria from reaching uninfected individuals. However, this effective method comes at a high cost as you need to isolate infected individuals in a remote place and provide food, drinks, daily necessities, protective gear, and shelter. 

:::tip
Public health strategies for bacteria are similar to public health strategies for viruses, as their spreading principles are the same. 

Pubic health strategies prevent bacterial infection (NOT killing the bacteria)
