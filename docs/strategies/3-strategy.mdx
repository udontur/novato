# Our Strategies
The following are our public and non-public health strategies for battling to Novato bacteria. Health strategies are a crucial part of protecting humanity without the use of eradication. 
## Public Health Strategies
These bacteria public health strategies also work for viruses. They all prevent bacterial infection instead of killing the bacteria after the infection.  
### Force Surgical Mask Use in Public Areas
For all citizens, a surgical mask must be used properly for ALL public areas like malls, markets, the street, MTR, etc. Due to this reason, ALL resturant must be changed to take-away only. 

The use of surgical mask can prevent the bacteria to mass spread as masks can block bacteria intake and output. (but not entirely). 

### Force Vaccination
After a vaccine is developed (by Dr. Jim Xiao), all citizens must take the vaccination unless there are proven medical concerns. 

Vaccines prevent bacterial infection by releasing inactive bacteria into the immune system. The immune system then indexes the bacteria and creates anti-bacterial cells for future reproduction.  
### Quarantine


:::tips
Bacteria public health strategies are similar to public health strategies for viruses as their spreading principles are the same. 

Pubic health strategies prevents bacterial infection (NOT killing the bacteria)
