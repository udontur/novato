# Past Anti-Bacteria Strategies
There are three main anti-bacterial strategies: Vaccines, Antibiotics, and public health measures. Most of these strategies can be adapted to antiviral strategies (antibiotics become medicine). 
## Vaccines
Vaccines prevent bacterial infection by releasing inactive bacteria into the immune system. The immune system then indexes the bacteria and creates anti-bacterial cells for future reproduction.  

A past example includes the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine (BCG). The BCG vaccine protects you from the tuberculosis bacteria. 
## Antibiotics
Antibiotics work by stopping some functions of the bacteria to suspend it (kill) permanently. However, some bacteria can develop antibiotic genes due to overuse.

## Public Health Measures
Public health measures are from Hong Kong COVID-19 as public health strategies for viruses also work for bacteria. 

Encourage the use of a surgical mask. A surgical mask can effectively prevent bacteria infections and prevent the spreading of bacteria by blocking the pathway between your nose and mouth. 

Encourage social distancing. Social distancing can prevent bacteria infection and spread by physically "blocking" the spreading pathway between each human being. Social distancing includes reducing seats in restaurants, working from home, taking an online class, etc. 

Quarantine is the best way to prevent already-infected individuals from further infecting others. It involves isolating an infected individual in an isolated container, such as the quarantine camp.

Encourage infection testing. Boost the supply of infection testing kits to prevent unknown cases from spreading around the city.  

Reduce the flow of people: This includes reducing the number of people on the street and external travelers. Hence, most airplane operations are shut down, everyone works from home, all schools offer online classes, and take-away-only restaurant rules are employed.
