# Past Anti-Bacteria Strategies
There are three main anti-bacteria strategy: Vaccines, Antibiotics, and public health measures. Most of these strategies cam be adapted for anti-virus strategies (antibiotics becomes medicine). 
## Vaccines
Vaccines prevents bacterial infection by releasing inactive bacteria to the immune system. The immune system will index the bacteria and create anti-bacteria cells for future reproduction.  

A past example include the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine (BCG).
