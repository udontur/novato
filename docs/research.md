# Research

Please navigate in the sidebar for all the pages.

Feel free to press the “Sun” icon on the top right corner of the website to activate dark mode.

### Info
This website is open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/udontur/novato), which means the entire source code of this website is available publicly.

:::tips
If you are a **DSC student doing the same assignment**, I personally **do not recommend** copying the source code.

### Weird statistics
Total hour wasted on debugging the website: ```1.5``` (My failed deployments: [Vercel Deploy](https://vercel.com/udonturs-projects/novato/deployments))

Total hour wasted on selecting a framework template: ```at least 2``` (i am too picky, deleted the repo multiple times already)

Total playlist count: ``2``

### To do list
- Add cards that direct to the sidebar
- The nav bar looks bad
- The home page looks even worse
