# Microscopes
Science is abstract. From electrons to cells, these fundamental elements lie beyond our sight, yet they power our computers, cure diseases, and shape the modern world. Microscopes transforms the abstract into reality, unlocking innovations that truly defines humanity.

Microscope is a tool that enlarge the image of a smaller object. It allows the operator to view and analyse miniture structures at a tanglable scale. 
## Microscope types
There are two main types of microscope: Optical microscope and Electron microscope.
### Optical Microscope
Optical microscopes (also know as compound microscopes) are found in nearly all labs, from school labs to research centers. When you think of a microscope, the image that pops up in your head is probably an optical microscope.

Optical microscopes enlarge minature objects by converging light rays. It is achieved by shining a light ray behind the minature object, and the light ray will travel through the object (usually a sample slide), through two convex lens can be used to magnify because it can focus image at closer range than the human eye

:::note
There are different kinds of optical microscopes that are assembled with a different structure. Some require multiple mirror, convex, and concave lens to redirect light rays. 

However, their underlying principles are the same.
