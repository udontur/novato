# Microscopes
Science is abstract. From electrons to cells, these fundamental elements lie beyond our sight, yet they power our computers, cure diseases, and shape the modern world. Microscopes transforms the abstract into reality, unlocking innovations that truly defines humanity.

Microscope is a tool that enlarge the image of a smaller object. It allows the operator to view and analyse miniature structures at a tangible scale. 
## Microscope types
There are two main types of microscope: Optical microscope and Electron microscope.
### Optical Microscope
Optical microscopes (also know as compound microscopes) are found in nearly all labs, from school labs to research centers. When you think of a microscope, the image that pops up in your head is probably an optical microscope.

Optical microscopes enlarge miniature objects by converging light rays. It is achieved by shining a light ray behind the miniature object, and the light ray will travel through the object (usually a sample slide), through two convex lens can be used to magnify because it can focus image at closer range than the human eye.

They usually max out at 1000x magnification and are commonly used for analyzing bacteria and animal cells. 

:::note
There are different kinds of optical microscopes that are assembled with a different structure. Some require multiple mirror, convex, and concave lens to redirect light rays. 

However, their underlying principles are the same.

The word "microscope" refers to "optical microscope" in the following sections. 
### Electron Microscope
Electron microscopes take magnification on a whole new level. You can zoom into individual atoms using a transmission electron microscope. 

Electron microscope takes image by shooting electron beams at the object and receiving the electrons using a sensor. There are two kinds of electron microscope: Transmission Electron Microscope shoot electron beams pass the thin object. Scanning Electron Microscope uses electron beams to scan through the object surface. 

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) are more complex and can produce images with higher resolution. It's max zoom is roughly 50 million times (0.05 nm). Shooting through the object allows the image to reveal the internal structure of the sample (like an xray).

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) can scale up to 1 million times (1 nm). It scans the surface of the sample like a printer and receives the electron using a sensor. Although it is not as powerful as the transmission electron microscope, it is still one thousand times more powerful than optical microscopes. 

Electron microscopes are commonly used for analysing viruses, engineering materials and designing computer chips.

However, this level of technology comes at a cost. SEMs can cost between 70 thousand to 1 million usd while TEMs can cost up to 10 million USD!

Aside from the cost, electron microscopes cannot produce a colored image because of it's nature. The colored electron microscope images are fake colors processed by computers.
