# Society Benefits
Science is abstract. From electrons to cells, these fundamental elements lie beyond our sight, yet they power our computers, cure diseases, and shape the modern world. Microscopes transform the abstract into reality, unlocking innovations that truly define humanity.

These are enhancing the understanding of biology, treating and researching disease (medical), and electronic development.

## Biology Research
In biology, microorganisms and cells are intangible. A human cannot see individual cells, let alone analyze their structure. The invention of microscopes fills in this gap. Anyone can use a microscope to observe and analyze cells, which promotes groundbreaking research in universities and research centers that enhance medical technology, our understanding of biology, and biotechnology. 

## Medical Research
Researchers can use the microscope to analyze bacteria and viruses and zoom into cells to expand our knowledge about these microorganisms. We can then use this knowledge to effectively produce medicine that treats diseases, saving millions of lives every year. 

## Electronic Development
Computer chips are tiny. A current generation CPU (Ryzen 9000 series) uses a mind-blowing 4nm FinFET architecture (this does not mean each transistor gate is 4nm wide)! Without the invention of an electron microscope, viewing these tiny chips during development is impossible.
